# Ethereum Data Syncer [![Ethereum Data Syncer CI](https://github.com/Rurutia1027/ethereum-data-syncer/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Rurutia1027/ethereum-data-syncer/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Ethereum Data Syncer is a powerful tool that helps developers synchronize Ethereum blockchain data across different platforms and environments. It supports multiple data types and request methods including real-time event subscription, data replay, and point-to-point JSON-RPC communication.

This project provides an easy-to-use interface to fetch, store, and process Ethereum data efficiently using various Ethereum data providers like Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode, and more.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Event Subscription**  
  Subscribe to Ethereum events using WebSocket connections and receive updates on transactions, blocks, and logs.

- **Data Replay**  
  Retrieve historical blockchain data with methods like `eth_getLogs` and `eth_getBlockByNumber`.

- **JSON-RPC API Requests**  
  Utilize Ethereum's standard JSON-RPC interface for querying block data, transaction information, smart contract events, and more.

- **Clear Documentation**  
  Comprehensive and detailed documentation on various data subscription methods, including explanations and use cases.  
  Helps developers understand the differences between real-time event subscription, data replay, and direct JSON-RPC queries.

- **Data Models and Tables**  
  Well-defined data models and schemas to track events, transactions, blocks, and logs, enabling developers to structure and store blockchain data effectively.

- **Multiple Data Sources Support**  
  Supports multiple data sources, including Ethereum API providers such as Infura, Alchemy, and QuickNode.  
  Easily integrates with custom data sources, including GraphQL, Kafka, and databases.

- **Extensible Custom Data Sources**  
  You can extend the system to support custom data sources, allowing for more flexible integrations with other blockchain networks or systems.

- **Cross-Platform Support**  
  Synchronize data from multiple platforms like Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode, and your own Ethereum node.

- **Customizable**  
  Easily extendable to support other Ethereum APIs and enhance synchronization capabilities.
